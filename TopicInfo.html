					<td>
						Algorithms are the step by step instructions that drive computers and most of our lives. They date back to 
						Ancient Greece where the first algorithms were invented to help solve math problems and even
						day to day tasks. Today algorithms can be found everywhere and can even dictate how we live our the rest
						of our lives. A few notable examples of major algorithms that have been developed is the searching
						algorithm used by the Google search engine, any matchmaking web site uses a different algorithms, 
						and Netflix and Amazon have their own algorithms as well to recomend items, based off what you have 
						watched and what you are interested in. This is the topic that computational thinking is based on and 
						something that we all do naturally as human beings.

				<tr>
					<td id="Decomposition">Decomposition</td>
					<td>
						Decomposition is simply the breaking down of larger problems into smaller, more managable problems.
						This is just as simple as breaking down your day into manageable tasks that need to be completed,
						or as complicated as breaking down a complex math problem. Decomposition is the way that computational
						thinking is handled, we have our algorithms, but in order to understand what is heppening and possibly 
						imporove on them, we must break it down into chunks. This is also very important part of how we, as 
						humans, go about managing our day to day lives. 
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td id="Control">Control Flow</td>
					<td>
						Control flow is very similar to what an algorithm is, except this is the specific order in which 
						instructions need to be carried out. This is similar to a dailey routine, if one activitiy is 
						performed out of order, the day feels incomplete or strange. This is exactly how a machine is. 
						If an algorithms steps are not completed in a certain order the output would be strange, wrong or
						cause bigger problems down the road. Another way to think about control flows is when we are following
						directions to a friends house. If we turn left at the wrong time, we might not end up in the right area, 
						whereas if we turn left when we are supposed to, we will find ourselves in the correct place.
						This is why control flows are necessary in succeeding in any given task.    
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td id="Data">Data Representation</td>
					<td>
						Data representation is the way information is stored and is often seen as two sided. In simple terms 
						we can communicated with eachother on a basic level using universal pictures that can be understood, 
						hence the formation of languages. In everyday terms we use data representation with out even realising it. 
						Texting your best friend or classmate is a form of text based data that we use daily. On the flip side
						creating a graph is a way to present large amounts of data in an easy to understand way. In order to understand
						what data we want to represent we must classify it. This can be anaything from what words make up the sentence, 
						to a range of peoples ages and how they coorespond to how many pets they own. Data representation is a way 
						we communicate with others and express our thoughts, ideas, and discoveries.
