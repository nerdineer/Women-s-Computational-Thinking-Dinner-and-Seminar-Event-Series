 				     I first got interested in CS when I TAed a computer science
				     course in high school. In this course, I got to see a variety
				     of projects being made as well as discovered that CS was applicable
				     to many different fields. I now apply psychology to CS, to help create
				 	better user interfaces and improve the user's exerpience. CS has taught me how to think differently
				     about problems I approach and has also helped me learn how to break
				     down problems further, rather than look at them from a big picture.
				     When I am not working on school, research or TAing for the intro CS
				     courses, I like to spend time with my friends and family, watch movies,
				     and read.

				     Hello! My name is Shannon and I am a junior in
				     Computer Science with a Minor in Business and
				     Entrepreneurship. I took a web development class in
				     high school and thought it was really cool so I decided
				     to pursue Computer Science in college. I love how Computer
				     Science can apply to so many different fields from traditional
				     tech to government to agriculture. The reason it cross applies
				     so much is because it is all about problem solving. Computer
				     Science has definitely increased my ability to tackle a variety
				     of problems in the real world in a logical and solid manner. In
				     addition to Computer Science, I also participate in Speech and
				     Debate and train horses. All in all, Computer Science allows me to
				     lead a very full and eclectic life.

				 I got interested in CS/ECE when I realized I love to play
				 video games and figuring out how things work. Studying this subject
				 has made me look at the world in a completely different way, for
				 example, I can now explain how something was made rather than guessing.
				 It has helped me with every day challenges, such as being able to come
				 up with different approaches to unexpected problems. Studying this subject
				 is not the only thing I do, I love to ski, ride horses, run, and hang
				 out with my friends.

			    I'm a Senior in Computer Science here at OSU.  I had an idea
			    for a physics-themed website in my senior year of high school,
			    and started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in an effort
			    to bring that to fruition. It never actually manifested, but
			    I switched to a CS major that summer and fell in love with
			    programming during CS 160.  Computer science has changed the way
			    I look at problems: once you have a hammer, everything is a nail!
			    It opens up options for how you can address issues that you see
			    or improve tools you use, and especially in the Open Source community
			    can help you help others. It's so empowering to contribute to other
			    projects, and know that when someone opens Firefox they're using a
			    little part of the code you wrote.  In my free time I enjoy working
			    out, hiking, cooking, and reading.

				Hi! My name is Lily and I'm a sophomore studying
				computer science and math. I took the introduction
				to computer science class at OSU on a whim and found I really
				loved coding. Programming has completely changed the way I
				think about solving problems. It has influenced the way I
				understand math, organize lab experiments, and even write essays.
				Apart from CS, I rock climb, bike, make art, and I speak Spanish
				and a decent amount of German.

			     My name is Megan and I am a sophomore in Electrical and
			     Computer Engineering. I got interested ECE as a child putting
			     together electrical kits, taking apart electronics and making a
			     small rover. ECE and Computer Science has taught me how to solve
			     problems I would normally give up on by thinking outside the box
			     and applying a more logical and algorithmic approach to the problem.
			     ECE and CS has helped me design and implement my logical thinking
			     to create unique projects like a Bluetooth driven robot that canâ€™t get
			     stuck on walls. Fun facts: I have been playing the violin for 11 years
			     and I spend my summers designing and creating costumes and props for
			     an annual anime convention.

				I started computer science when I was in high school;
				I needed another class and figured I liked computers and
				I liked science, so I should try this "computer science" thing.
				I loved the creative problem solving and the logic involved
				and fell in love with computer science. CS has made me approach
				problems differently and because of it, I know how to decompose
				large tasks into small things I can take care of myself without
				being overwhelmed. Throughout high school and college, I have also
				been highly involved with my school's color guard and marching band!
